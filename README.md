Description of Uni Project
-------------------------
An airlineâ€™s reservation system does not allow the same name to be registered twice for a single flight. Write a program that reads the names of passengers on an aircraft with a maximum of 100 seats and stores them in an appropriate list. The registration should stop when four dashes ('----') are entered instead of a name. The program should not allow duplicate names in the list and, finally, it should display the names of all passengers on the flight
